// Always remeber JavaScript is single threaded

// {} this is execution context 
// There are three types of execution context
// 1. Global Execution Context
// 2. Function Execution Context
// 3. Eval Execution Context (e.g in mongo, add as global property, (this optional only in some environment => global))


// there are two major phases
// 1. Memory Creation Phase (MCP) => Creation Phase
// 2. Execution Phase

// There are two types of execution contexts: global and function. 
// The global execution context is created when a JavaScript script first starts to run, 
// and it represents the global scope in JavaScript. A function execution context is created 
// whenever a function is called, representing the function's local scope.

// Execution Context is like a big box or container where all JavaScript code is executed. 
// Also, before continuing reading remember that JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded 
// language. Single-threaded means that JavaScript can execute one command at a time.
